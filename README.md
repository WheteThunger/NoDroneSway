## Features

Drones no longer sway in the wind, if they have attachments.

## When to use this plugin

This is an import plugin if you are using other drone plugins that add attachments to drones, including:

- Drone Boombox
- Drone Storage
- Drone Turrets
- Mega Drones
- Ridable Drones

## Consequences

Non-swaying drones cannot have their camera tilted up and down. This cannot be fixed.
